**Plant microbiota has essential functions in improving plant nutrition**

- The molecular mechanisms driving nutrient acquisition have been thoroughly studied for plant symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Rhizobium bacteria
  
- Non-symbiotic plant-growth-promoting bacteria can either enhance the bioavailability of insoluble minerals or improve the root system architecture of host plants, thus increasing the exploratory capacity of the root for water and minerals
