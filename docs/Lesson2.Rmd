- (a) **Antibiosis**: The bacterium colonizes the growing root system and delivers antibiotic molecules around the root, thereby harming pathogens that approach the root

- (b) **Induced systemic resistance** (ISR): many bacterial products induce systemic signaling, which can result in protection of the whole plant against diseases caused by different organisms
  
- (c) **Competition for nutrients and niches**: Biocontrol bacteria acting through this mechanism excel in fast chemotactic movement along the growing root in their efficient hunt for root exudate components, thereby outcompeting the pathogen in scavenging nutrients and in occupying niches on the root

- `r fontawesome::fa("flask", fill = "grey")` Microbes were isolated from the rhizospheres of tomato plants. Grown briefly in liquid and used to inoculate sterile germinated seedlings. After those microbes had reached the 1-cm-long root tip were shaken off the root tip, plated on KB agar, judged for colony diversity, and the cells from the combined colonies were used for another enrichment cycle. After a total of three cycles the bacteria were selected for competitive root colonization experiments.
  
-  `r fontawesome::fa("plus-circle", fill = "green")` The observation that bacteria selected by the enrichment method grow much better on exudate than random rhizobacteria shows that these strains utilize exudates components more efficiently for growth. It suggests that competition for nutrients plays a major role in the biocontrol activity of the enhanced colonizers
