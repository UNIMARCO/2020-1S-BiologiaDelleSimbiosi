- Specific ecotypes that live in different parts of the water column and are **tuned to the different light and nutrient regimes**

- Given the prevalence of phage-encoded photosynthesis proteins and the occurrence of recombination between phage and host genes, phage populations are expected to **serve as gene reservoirs**

**What is endogenization?**
.m0tp[
.par25[

- An endogenous viral element (**EVE**) is a viral DNA sequence, present within the germline of a non-viral organism

- EVE may be entire viral genome or a fragment of viral genome

- EVEs are **usually eliminated** from the host gene pool within a small number of generations, but they can sometimes **reach fixation**

- EVEs that occur as **proviruses** can potentially remain capable of **producing infectious virus**

- Endogenous retroviruses are a **common ancestral feature of mammalian genomes** with most having been inactivated over time through mutation and deletion

- Koala retrovirus (**KoRV**) is associated with koala neoplasia

- KoRV also shows features of a recently inserted endogenous retrovirus that is vertically transmitted

- **Isolated koala populations** have not yet incorporated KoRV into their genomes suggesting that KoRV is a **virus in transition** between an exogenous and endogenous element

.m0tp[

- Example of a viral gene that has been sequestered to serve an important function in the physiology of a mammalian host

- This gene, encoding a protein that we have called **syncytin**, is the envelope gene of a recently identified **human endogenous defective retrovirus**, HERV-W

- Data indicate that syncytin may be important in **human placental morphogenesis**

- **Syncytin disregulation or dysfunction** is involved in pathologies such as preeclampsia or choriocarcinoma is a focus of ongoing studies

**Endogenous retroviral sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of a human salivary amylase gene**
.m0tp[
.par20[

- The human genome contains three salivary and two pancreatic amylase genes

- The three **salivary amylase genes** are each associated with an **intact retroviral element**

- The two **pancreatic amylase genes** either lack retroviral sequences (AMY2B) or contain a solo LTR as a result of excision of the retrovirus (AMY2A). 

- The gene structures are consistent with a sequence of events in which **insertion of the retrovirus converted a pancreatic amylase gene like AMY2B into a salivary-specific gene**, and excision of the retrovirus resulted in a return to pancreas-specific expression of AMY2A.

- A mutualistic association between a fungal endophyte and a tropical panic grass allows both organisms to grow at high soil temperatures

- **Fungal isolates cured of the virus are unable to confer heat tolerance**, but heat tolerance is restored after the virus is reintroduced

- The virus-infected fungus **confers heat tolerance not only to its native monocot host but also to a eudicot host**, which suggests that the underlying mechanism involves pathways conserved between these two groups of plants
