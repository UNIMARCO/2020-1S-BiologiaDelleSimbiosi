- The oceans cover **more than 70%** of the Earth‚Äôs surface

- They control the **climate**, provide a significant amount of the **protein** that is consumed globally and produce approximately **half of the Earth‚Äôs oxygen**

- Microorganisms are a major force behind the **nutrient and energy cycles** in the world‚Äôs oceans

- It is estimated that **viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass per day**

- As well as being agents of mortality, viruses are one of the **largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity** on the Earth.

- **Virosphere** is the portion of the Earth in which viruses occur or which is affected by viruses

- The virosphere is inclusive of **every environment on the Earth**, from the atmosphere to the deep biosphere

- Nowhere is the importance of viruses more evident than in the world‚Äôs oceans

- Viruses are substantial **agents of mortality** in heterotrophic and autotrophic plankton

- Viruses are major players in the mortality of marine microorganisms and, consequently, **affect nutrient and energy cycles** as well as the structure of microbial communities

- Need to incorporate viruses and virus-mediated processes into our understanding of **ocean biology** and biogeochemistry

**The abundance of marine viruses**
.m0tp[
.par25[

- The abundance of viruses in oceans exceeds that of bacteria and archaea by approximately 15-fold and comprising approximately **94% of the nucleic-acid-containing particles**

- However, because of their extremely small size, viruses represent only approximately **5% of the biomass**

- In the oceans, viral abundance decreases further offshore and deeper in the water column because it generally **varies along with the prokaryotic abundance**

**The abundance of marine viruses**
.par20m[

- Six methods are used to estimate the abundance of viruses in aquatic samples
  - plaque assays (PAs) and most-probable-number assays (MPNs): are used to quantify the abundance of infectious units that cause the lysis of a particular host.
  - transmission electron microscopy (TEM): TEM is the only method that provides data on both the abundance and morphology of virus-like particles (fig a)
  - **epifluorescence microscopy** (EfM): the viruses are concentrated on a membrane filter, their nucleic acids are stained with a brightly fluorescent dye and the abundance of viruses is estimated (fig b)
  - flow cytometry (FC): accurate high-throughput method also allows the quantification of subpopulations of viruses
  - **Next generation sequencing**

**Viruses, mortality and elemental cycling**
.m0tp[
.par23[

- As agents of mortality, viruses have a range of effects on the world‚Äôs oceans, from altering geochemical cycles to structuring populations and communities.

- 20-40% of prokaryotes in surface water are removed by viruses every day (similar to the amount killed by grazing)
  
- Increase in the rate of viral reproduction in response to an increase in the growth rate of host cells is a strong feedback mechanism that would probably prevent dominance by the fastest growing taxa

**Viral shunt**
.m0tp[
.par20[

- **Viral shunt**: the viral-mediated movement of nutrients from organisms to pools of dissolved and non-living particulate organic matter

- The viral shunt moves material from living organisms into **particulate organic matter** (POM) and **dissolved organic matter** (DOM) 

- However, the effects can also be more profound and potentially include:
  - the **release of dimethyl sulphide**, a gas that affects the Earth‚Äôs climate
  - the **remobilization of the organically complexed iron** that limits primary production in much of the world‚Äôs oceans (for example, the viral lysis of prokaryotes liberates sufficient amounts of biologically available iron to support the needs of phytoplankton)

**Viral shunt in recycling DoM**
.m0tp[
.par20m[

- DOM, the **largest reservoir of carbon in the oceans**, is only available for uptake by bacteria

- There are **two main forms of bacterial mortality**: predation by unicellular eukaryotic grazers or lysis by phages
  - **Grazing** moves carbon up through the trophic levels from bacteria to protozoa to zooplankton to fish and larger organisms
  - When bacteria are **lysed by phages**, carbon and nutrients flow through the viral shunt and are remineralized by bacteria within the microbial loop, making the viral shunt function as the ocean‚Äôs recycling system

**Viral shunt in recycling PoM**
.m0tp[
.par20m[

- The biological pump (BP) is a combination of processes that leads to the sequestration of carbon in the deep ocean as the result of the sinking of **PoM** from surface waters

- The amount of carbon that is exported by the BP has direct implications for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

- Carbon from cell lysis will sink more slowly and be retained to a greater extent in surface waters, where much of it will be converted to dissolved inorganic carbon by respiration or solar radiation

**Viruses manipulate the marine environment**
.pull-left[
.m0tp[
.par25[

- Until now we focused on two areas:
  - **viruses as pathogens** of aquatic organisms
  - **virus-driven dynamics** of the marine microbial food web

- Marine viruses can affect their hosts and environments in startling ways:
  - **Global transfer** of niche adaptation genes
  - Modifications of the **ontogeny and ecology** of marine organisms


**It has become clear that the marine virome is a master of manipulation**

*Accessory gene expression*
.m0tp[
.par20[

- Consider the **cyanobacteria**l which together account for about 25% of global photosynthesis

- Sequencing of the marine viral **cyanophage**s that infect these primary producers showed that **genes involved in photosynthesis** are commonly carried in phage genome

- During the lytic cycle, most of the host‚Äôs transcription and translation is **shut down by phage**

- By expressing genes involved in photosynthesis, **phage generate the energy necessary for viral production**

*Horizontal gene transfer*

- One consequence of cyanophage carrying genes involved in the photosynthesis is the **horizontal gene transfer of photosynthetic genetic elements** between hosts

- Specific ecotypes that live in different parts of the water column and are **tuned to the different light and nutrient regimes**

- Given the prevalence of phage-encoded photosynthesis proteins and the occurrence of recombination between phage and host genes, phage populations are expected to **serve as gene reservoirs**

# Endogenous Virus Elements

.pull-left[
**What is endogenization?**
.m0tp[
.par25[

- An endogenous viral element (**EVE**) is a viral DNA sequence, present within the germline of a non-viral organism

- EVE may be entire viral genome or a fragment of viral genome

- EVEs are **usually eliminated** from the host gene pool within a small number of generations, but they can sometimes **reach fixation**

- EVEs that occur as **proviruses** can potentially remain capable of **producing infectious virus**

**Retroviral invasion of the koala genome**
.m0tp[
.par20[

- Endogenous retroviruses are a **common ancestral feature of mammalian genomes** with most having been inactivated over time through mutation and deletion

- Koala retrovirus (**KoRV**) is associated with koala neoplasia

- KoRV also shows features of a recently inserted endogenous retrovirus that is vertically transmitted

- **Isolated koala populations** have not yet incorporated KoRV into their genomes suggesting that KoRV is a **virus in transition** between an exogenous and endogenous element

- Opportunity to study the process and consequences of retroviral endogenization in action
