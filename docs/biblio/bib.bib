The fast pace of development of these tools and the complexity of metagenomic data make it important that researchers are able to benchmark their performance. Here, we review current approaches for metagenomic analysis and evaluate the performance of 20 metagenomic classifiers using simulated and experimental datasets. We describe the key metrics used to assess performance, offer a framework for the comparison of additional classifiers, and discuss the future of metagenomic data analysis.},

	Abstract = {As abundant members of microbial communities, viruses impact microbial mortality, carbon and nutrient cycling, and food web dynamics. Although most of our information about viral communities comes from marine systems, evidence is mounting to suggest that viruses are similarly important in soil. Here I outline soil viral metagenomic approaches and the current state of soil viral ecology as a field, and then I highlight existing knowledge gaps that we can begin to fill. We are poised to elucidate soil viral contributions to terrestrial ecosystem processes, considering: the full suite of potential hosts across trophic scales, the ecological impacts of different viral replication strategies, links to economically relevant outcomes like crop productivity, and measurable in situ virus-host population dynamics across spatiotemporal scales and environmental conditions. Soon, we will learn how soil viruses contribute to food webs linked to organic matter decomposition, carbon and nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural productivity.mSystems{\textregistered} vol. 4, no. 3, is a special issue sponsored by Illumina.},

	Abstract = {The use of green remediation technologies (i.e., phytoremediation, bioremediation, mycoremediation) for the restoration of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites is one of the keys for sustainable development. These technologies rely on the joint action of biotic components of the ecosystem, namely, plants, bacteria, and fungi. Despite the fact that previous studies showed that the clean-up of hydrocarbons could be achieved individually by plants or microorganisms, present investigations suggest that the interaction of plants with their surrounding microbiome determines the outcomes of green remediation technologies. This book chapter reviews the state of the art to explain the two-way relationship established between plants and their associated microbiome in hydrocarbon-polluted soils. Special focus is put on stressing the results obtained in recent studies that employ omics approaches.},

	Abstract = {The hill environments cover about 27{\%} of the total land surface of earth, and the Himalaya lies in North East India, comprised of 65{\%} mountainous area. Agriculture is the primary source of income in hills; however, it has several intrinsic limitations, i.e. inaccessibility, underutilization of natural resources, climatic impact, and environmental limitations. There are various factors affecting the productivity of the hill agroecosystems including soil conditions, change in precipitation, temperature, and climate change in recent years. In addition, nowadays the traditional agriculture practices have been influenced by modernization which have ignored the key resource base of traditional crops in hills and resulted in considerable loss of microbial diversity. Microorganism in soil plays a crucial role in preserving the soil health, its productivity, and allover ecosystem functioning. The diverse population and metabolism of bacteria, fungi, and archaea enhance the availability of essential minerals and trace elements through their complex redox reactions and colonization into the soil. Considering the constrains and limitation of hill agriculture, it is essential to investigate about the microbial functional signatures, viz. energetics and regulatory circuits and structural genes regulating different metabolic pathways, which can directly address to the potential of microbial functions that are related to agroecosystem processes. The advancement in the molecular techniques, viz. high-throughput metagenomics enabling the soil scientists to investigate the microbial communities in detail to harness their potential for productivity of hill agroecosystems.},

This complex plant-associated microbial community, also referred to as the second genome of the plant, is crucial for plant health. Recent advances in plant--microbe interactions research revealed that plants are able to shape their rhizosphere microbiome, as evidenced by the fact that different plant species host specific microbial communities when grown on the same soil. In this review, we discuss evidence that upon pathogen or insect attack, plants are able to recruit protective microorganisms, and enhance microbial activity to suppress pathogens in the rhizosphere. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that govern selection and activity of microbial communities by plant roots will provide new opportunities to increase crop production.},

	Abstract = {Decreasing fertility of soil and farm profitability is a noteworthy worldwide concern keeping in mind the end goal to accomplish food security for a prospering total population. The modification of soil microbiomes to enhance crop production is an antiquated practice. The rhizosphere is the region of the soil being persistently impacted by plant roots through the rhizodeposition of exudates, adhesives, and sloughed cells. Mutually, the organisms present in rhizosphere can impact the plant by secreting regulatory compounds. It's very important to understand what genes and functions microbes use to colonize plants because only then have a chance to rationally devise useful `plant probiotics' to help us raise more food and energy crops. Both recently implemented genomic approaches and classical microbiology techniques continue to develop the science of plant-microbe interactions. These investigations of plant microbiome have profited from all-encompassing biological on one-hand and reductionist robotic disclosures on the other. The generation of vast isolate collections what's more, the investigation of engineered microbial groups in blend with plant genetic assets, will permit us to fill this gap and to direct reductionist, speculation driven examinations in progressively complex biological settings up to field tests. These advances can possibly change our comprehension of plant-organism collaborations in nature and in farming and will contribute fundamentally to the following green revolution.},

	Abstract = {The phyllosphere is an important habitat for a diverse microbiome and an important entry point for many pathogens. Factors that shape the phyllosphere microbiome and also the co-existence among members and how they affect disease development are largely understudied. In this study we examined the wheat mycobiome by using metabarcoding of the fungal ITS1 region. Leaf samples were taken from four cultivars grown at two locations in Denmark. Samples were taken from the three uppermost leaves and at three growth stages to better understand spatiotemporal variation of the mycobiome. Analysis of read abundances showed that geographical location had a major effect in shaping the mycobiome in the total dataset, but also leaf position, growth stage and cultivar were important drivers of fungal communities. Cultivar was most important in explaining variation in older leaves whereas location better explained the variation in younger leaves, suggesting that communities are shaped over time by the leaf environment. Network analysis revealed negative co-existence between Zymoseptoria tritici and the yeasts Sporobolomyces, Dioszegia, and Cystofilobasidiaceae.

	Abstract = {Melojo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) is a key tree species of Mediterranean forests; however, these forests show an advanced stage of deterioration in the Iberian Peninsula. Plant-associated microorganisms play an essential role improving their host's fitness, hence, a better understanding of oak rhizospheric microbiome, especially of those active members, could be the first step towards microbiome-based approaches for oak-forest improvement. Here we reported, for the first time, the diversity of total (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) bacterial communities of different melojo-oak forest formations through pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. We found that potentially active bacterial communities were as rich and diverse as total bacterial communities, but different in terms of relative abundance patterns in some of the studied areas. Both core microbiomes were dominated by a relatively small percentage of OTUs, most of which showed positive correlation between both libraries. However, the uncoupling between abundance (rDNA) and potential activity (rRNA) for some taxa suggests that the most abundant taxa are not always the most active, and that low-abundance OTUs may have a strong influence on oak's rhizospheric ecology. Thus, measurement of rRNA:rDNA ratio could be helpful in identifying major players for the development of bacterial bioinoculants.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Plant diseases cause huge losses by changing the quality and quantity of harvested crops. Many disease symptoms caused by bacteria or fungi rely on the involvement of plant hormones, while other plant hormones act as defense signals in the plant. In this review the role of auxins in these processes will be evaluated. Some growth promoting plant hormones cause disease symptoms. For example auxins stimulate cell division and cell elongation in a healthy plant, but tumor formation after bacterial infection. Thus, control of auxin levels and auxin signaling pathways significantly contribute to the defense network in plants. Auxin can also act directly as defense molecule with antimicrobial activity. Since much research has been done in the recent years on auxin as a pathogenicity factor for many diseases, several examples will be presented to highlight the complexity between normal plant growth, which is regulated by auxin, and processes determining resistance or susceptibility, triggered by the same class of molecules.},

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Grapevine is a well-studied, economically relevant crop, whose associated bacteria could influence its organoleptic properties. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with grapevine organs (leaves, flowers, grapes, and roots) and soils were characterized over two growing seasons to determine the influence of vine cultivar, edaphic parameters, vine developmental stage (dormancy, flowering, preharvest), and vineyard. Belowground bacterial communities differed significantly from those aboveground, and yet the communities associated with leaves, flowers, and grapes shared a greater proportion of taxa with soil communities than with each other, suggesting that soil may serve as a bacterial reservoir. A subset of soil microorganisms, including root colonizers significantly enriched in plant growth-promoting bacteria and related functional genes, were selected by the grapevine. In addition to plant selective pressure, the structure of soil and root microbiota was significantly influenced by soil pH and C:N ratio, and changes in leaf- and grape-associated microbiota were correlated with soil carbon and showed interannual variation even at small spatial scales. Diazotrophic bacteria, e.g., Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobium spp., were significantly more abundant in soil samples and root samples of specific vineyards. Vine-associated microbial assemblages were influenced by myriad factors that shape their composition and structure, but the majority of organ-associated taxa originated in the soil, and their distribution reflected the influence of highly localized biogeographic factors and vineyard management.
IMPORTANCE: Vine-associated bacterial communities may play specific roles in the productivity and disease resistance of their host plant. Also, the bacterial communities on grapes have the potential to influence the organoleptic properties of the wine, contributing to a regional terroir. Understanding that factors that influence these bacteria may provide insights into management practices to shape and craft individual wine properties. We show that soil serves as a key source of vine-associated bacteria and that edaphic factors and vineyard-specific properties can influence the native grapevine microbiome preharvest.},

	Abstract = {Citrus is a globally important, perennial fruit crop whose rhizosphere microbiome is thought to play an important role in promoting citrus growth and health. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional composition of the citrus rhizosphere microbiome. We use both amplicon and deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of bulk soil and rhizosphere samples collected across distinct biogeographical regions from six continents. Predominant taxa include Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The core citrus rhizosphere microbiome comprises Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Cupriavidus, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Burkholderia, Cellvibrio, Sphingomonas, Variovorax and Paraburkholderia, some of which are potential plant beneficial microbes. We also identify over-represented microbial functional traits mediating plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, nutrition acquisition and plant growth promotion in citrus rhizosphere. The results provide valuable information to guide microbial isolation and culturing and, potentially, to harness the power of the microbiome to improve plant production and health.},

	Abstract = {Healthy plants host diverse but taxonomically structured communities of microorganisms, the plant microbiota, that colonize every accessible plant tissue. Plant-associated microbiomes confer fitness advantages to the plant host, including growth promotion, nutrient uptake, stress tolerance and resistance to pathogens. In this Review, we explore how plant microbiome research has unravelled the complex network of genetic, biochemical, physical and metabolic interactions among the plant, the associated microbial communities and the environment. We also discuss how those interactions shape the assembly of plant-associated microbiomes and modulate their beneficial traits, such as nutrient acquisition and plant health, in addition to highlighting knowledge gaps and future directions.},

	Abstract = {Plants have evolved with a plethora of microorganisms having important roles for plant growth and health. A considerable amount of information is now available on the structure and dynamics of plant microbiota as well as on the functional capacities of isolated community members. Due to the interesting functional potential of plant microbiota as well as due to current challenges in crop production there is an urgent need to bring microbial innovations into practice. Different approaches for microbiome improvement exist. On the one hand microbial strains or strain combinations can be applied, however, field success is often variable and improvement is urgently required. Smart, knowledge-driven selection of microorganisms is needed as well as the use of suitable delivery approaches and formulations. On the other hand, farming practices or the plant genotype can influence plant microbiota and thus functioning. Therefore, selection of appropriate farming practices and plant breeding leading to improved plant-microbiome interactions are avenues to increase the benefit of plant microbiota. In conclusion, different avenues making use of a new generation of inoculants as well as the application of microbiome-based agro-management practices and improved plant lines could lead to a better use of the plant microbiome. This paper reviews the importance and functionalities of the bacterial plant microbiome and discusses challenges and concepts in regard to the application of plant-associated bacteria.},

	Abstract = {Interest toward the human microbiome, particularly gut microbiome has flourished in recent decades owing to the rapidly advancing sequence-based screening and humanized gnotobiotic model in interrogating the dynamic operations of commensal microbiota. Although this field is still at a very preliminary stage, whereby the functional properties of the complex gut microbiome remain less understood, several promising findings have been documented and exhibit great potential toward revolutionizing disease etiology and medical treatments. In this review, the interactions between gut microbiota and the host have been focused on, to provide an overview of the role of gut microbiota and their unique metabolites in conferring host protection against invading pathogen, regulation of diverse host physiological functions including metabolism, development and homeostasis of immunity and the nervous system. We elaborate on how gut microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) may lead to dysfunction of host machineries, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and/or progression toward a broad spectrum of diseases. Some of the most notable diseases namely Clostridium difficile infection (infectious disease), inflammatory bowel disease (intestinal immune-mediated disease), celiac disease (multisystemic autoimmune disorder), obesity (metabolic disease), colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder (neuropsychiatric disorder) have been discussed and delineated along with recent findings. Novel therapies derived from microbiome studies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotic and prebiotics to target associated diseases have been reviewed to introduce the idea of how certain disease symptoms can be ameliorated through dysbiosis correction, thus revealing a new scientific approach toward disease treatment. Toward the end of this review, several research gaps and limitations have been described along with suggested future studies to overcome the current research lacunae. Despite the ongoing debate on whether gut microbiome plays a role in the above-mentioned diseases, we have in this review, gathered evidence showing a potentially far more complex link beyond the unidirectional cause-and-effect relationship between them.},
