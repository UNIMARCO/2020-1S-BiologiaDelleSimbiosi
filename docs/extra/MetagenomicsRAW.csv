Nanopore Sequencing,"Dependent on library preparation, not the device, so user chooses read length (up to 2,272,580 bp reported[89]).",~92–97% single read,dependent on read length selected by user,data streamed in real time. Choose 1 min to 48 hrs,$7–100,Longest individual reads. Accessible user community. Portable (Palm sized).,"Lower throughput than other machines, Single read accuracy in 90s."
Chain termination (Sanger sequencing),400 to 900 bp,99.9%,N/A,20 minutes to 3 hours,"$2,400,000",Useful for many applications.,More expensive and impractical for larger sequencing projects. This method also requires the time-consuming step of plasmid cloning or PCR.
